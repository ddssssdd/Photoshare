For instance, should the user allow a minor to use his/her account without the permission of the parent or legal guardian, the user therewith acknowledges that he/she is fully responsible for the acts of said user, for monitoring access to the account, for use of the product offering by said user and the consequences resulting from any misuse.{html_p_end}\n{html_br}\n{html_br}\n{html_p_start}3.2 The user must refrain from acts that negatively affect or could negatively affect the product offering of Pinspire GmbH from functioning properly (e.g. by software or other scripts).

  <string name="faq.body"><![CDATA[<h3 class="faq_title">About Pinspire</h3>\n  \n<p class="faq_question">What is Pinspire?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">Pinspire is a virtual pinboard - a place to save the pictures, messages, and things that inspire you. You can save images of your favorite fashion and hair styles, recipes and food, or places and people into organized collections. Pinspire\'s goal is to serve as a place for people to find inspiration for all aspects of their lives.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">Who can use Pinspire and what does it cost?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">Pinspire is free and open to anyone. You can use your Facebook account, Twitter account, or email to {0}.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">What can I do with Pinspire?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">Pinspire is a great place to save things that inspire you and share your style and stories with others in the Pinspire community. You can save a gift list, plan a home redecoration, or share pictures from your own life. We hope you will inspire and be inspired by Pinspire\'s passionate community.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">What countries does pinspire operate in and in what languages?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">Pinspire has pins from hundreds of thousands of people from all over the world. You can see a list of our countries by navigating to the flag icon in the top right corner. All of these countries offer the site controls, pins and other content in local languages. We want everyone in the world to have a great experience on Pinspire. And we know our users also enjoy seeing what people in other countries are pinning and saying - go ahead and explore!</p>\n<p class="faq_question">How do I get started?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">After signing up, you can browse pins using our Whats Hot page, category menu, or search box. When you find something you want to keep, click the repin icon. After clicking repin, you can create a collection for this pin, enter a description and save it. Repeat this and you\'re on your way!</p>\n  \n<h3 class="faq_title">Pinning Basics</h3>\n  \n<p class="faq_question">What is a pin?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">A pin is an image added to Pinspire along with the description and comments people have left about it. Pins can come from other websites or from users uploading them. They are free to add and you can add as many as you like. We keep the image of the pin so it will never go away, even if the site it was pinned from does.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">What is a repin?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">A repin is a pin copied from an existing pin. When users find pins they like, they click repin to save it onto their own collection. This creates a new pin with the same image and URL as the original.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">What is a collection?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">A collection is an organized group of pictures. Collections have a name and can have as many pins saved to them as you want.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">What is following?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">Following a user\'s board means that pins from this board will appear in the "People you follow" page. Following a user means that all of this user\'s boards, including new pins, will appear. You can follow a user by clicking on their profile thumbnail and clicking "Follow" beneath their profile picture. You can follow a board by viewing that board and clicking the "follow" button at the top.</p>\n  \n<h3 class="faq_title">Account Management</h3>\n  \n<p class="faq_question">How do I sign up?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">You can {1} with Facebook, Twitter, or email for free here. For email signup, all that is required is your name and password. For Facebook and Twitter signup, all that is required is an existing account with those sites.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">How do I edit my account information including name, email settings and picture?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">You can edit all of your account settings in the "Settings" page. To navigate to Settings, mouseover your profile pic in the top right banner and select "Settings" under the "My Account" section.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">How do I connect my account to Facebook, Facebook Timeline, or Twitter?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">If you have not signed up, you can connect to Facebook and Twitter on signup. If you are signed up, you can connect or disconnect to Facebook in the account Settings page by simply clicking a checkbox and clicking "allow". To connect to Timeline, connect your account to Facebook and then click "Connect" in the timeline header on the top of the Pinspire homepage.</p>\n  \n<h3 class="faq_title">Getting the most from Pinspire</h3>\n  \n<p class="faq_question">What does the Pin It bookmark do?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">By dragging or adding the {2} to your browser\'s bookmark bar, you can add pictures from other websites back to your Pinspire profile. You don\'t need to have Pinspire open for this to work. Simply visit a site you like, click the bookmark link, and then select your image. The following popup will allow you to login, select and board and pin the image back to your account.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">How do I add a Pin It button to my website?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">You need to fill out the image URL, site URL, and pin description in {3}. Then copy the resulting code and add it next to the image you want your users to pin. Adding this button increases the chances people will pin your pin, which will drive traffic back to your site as each link pin links directly to you.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">How do I put a follow me on Pinspire button on my site?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">Create a Pinspire account and then copy the code snippet {4} and place it on your website where you want the button to appear.</p>\n<p class="faq_question">How can I improve my profile, number of views, and followers?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">Pinning new images onto good collections is the only way to get your pins into our Whats Hot and category pages. So once you have created great collections of new and repined content, you should start seeing increased number of repins, likes, and comments. This will drive more people to view your profile and follow your pins. Once you have followers, it is even easier to get your pins seen!</p>\n<p class="faq_question">How do I contact Pinspire?</p>\n<p class="faq_answer">You can contact us {5}. We read every email we get.</p>]]></string>
